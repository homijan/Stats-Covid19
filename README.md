# Stats-Covid19
This repo tracks the impact of Covid19 on countries around the world.

Notice that we show a normalized data with respect to population or country or region.

It should help to better understand and predict the phase of spread, while compared to other
countries. Unfortunately, it seems that European countries will suffer from a higher death-rate compared to China.
